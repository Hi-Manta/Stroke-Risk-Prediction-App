# 🧠 Stroke Risk Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This is a **Stroke Risk Prediction** web app built with **Streamlit**. The app allows users to input their health details and predicts their **stroke risk percentage (%)** using a trained **XGBoost Regressor model**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **User-friendly UI** with an intuitive layout
- ✅ **Real-time risk prediction** based on health indicators
- ✅ **Color-coded risk assessment** (Low, Moderate, High)
- ✅ **Progress bar visualization** for easy interpretation
- ✅ **Error handling** for missing model files

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** XGBoost, NumPy, Pandas
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Deployment:** (To be added if deployed)

## ⚡ Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stroke-Risk-Prediction.git
cd Stroke-Risk-Prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed, then run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the App
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Model Details
The model used in this project is an **XGBoost Regressor**, trained to predict stroke risk based on health features.

### 🔧 Model Training (Optional)
If you need to train a new model, modify and run the training script (not included yet). Save the trained model as `GB_model.pkl` before running the app.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add real-time model training within the app
- [ ] Deploy on **Streamlit Cloud** or **Render**
- [ ] Improve dataset with more features for better accuracy
